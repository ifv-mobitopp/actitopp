# actiTopp

actiTopp is a model to generate week activity schedules. The implementation is developed at the [Institute for Transport Studies](http://www.ifv.kit.edu) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. actiTopp is part of our travel demand model [mobiTopp](http://www.ifv.kit.edu/359.php) but can also be used seperately.

More information about the model itself can be found [here](https://trid.trb.org/View/1437316).
